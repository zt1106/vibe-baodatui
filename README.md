# Vibe Baodatui
This mono-repository delivers a multiplayer poker experience with a Next.js client, an Express + Socket.IO backend, shared TypeScript utilities, and focused testing tools. The workspace is composed of `apps/web` for the UI, `apps/server` for the API + game state hosting, and reusable packages such as `packages/game-core` and `packages/shared` for game logic, contracts, and helpers. Run workspace commands through `pnpm` (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm test`, etc.) from the root, and follow the repository `AGENTS.md` notes for conventions, environment setup, and Playwright workflows.
